<article style=""><h1>Cop Who Killed 12-Year-Old Described As Emotionally Unstable, "Dismal" With A Firearm</h1><p>The police officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice is described as emotionally unstable and unable to properly use a firearm, according to documents from the city of Independence, Ohio, obtained by BuzzFeed News. The Cleveland Police Department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that during Officer Loehmann's background check "Cleveland Police detectives did not review his Independence Police Department personnel file."</p><img src="http://s3-static-ak.buzzfed.com/static/2014-12/4/11/campaign_images/webdr11/cop-who-killed-12-year-old-described-as-emotional-2-23712-1417710563-5_dblbig.jpg" /></article>

Police are Losing Credibility

Andy Griffith, the helpful figure that was interested in doing not only the right thing, but also the polite thing, disappeared a long time ago. In his place, we got dirty harry, the no-nonsense screw city hall cop who was really interested in making the bad guys pay. Now we have, "Justified" where cops feel it's OK to simply shoot people that they deem "guilty".

This is having a very negative effect on the criminal justice system. More and more, people are realizing that law enforcement officers are "testilying" on the stand. No one expects a polite police officer anymore. Nowadays, a large segment of our society simply hopes they don't get shot by the police.

Let's start with what really kicked it off recently, the Michael Brown case. Ferguson, Missouri. The officer shoots Michael Brown, even though Brown was unarmed. The officer is then allowed to leave the scene without being questioned by independent homicide detectives. Distrust grows, the media grabs hold of the story, and we begin to learn that the Ferguson police department has been preying upon the poor and underprivleged for months and years in order to subsidize the budget.

Next, Eric Garner. the New York case which was caught on tape, and which was seen by millions of Americans. A man was strangled to death by a police officer while other police officers watched. No charges filed.
![For several minutes after the shooting, Walter L. Scott remained face down with his hands cuffed behind his back.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/abc6c837-984e-4cfd-8a23-160b9a6ec7b7.jpg)

Next, we get the South Carolina case of Walter Scott.  An officer shoots Walter Scott, then plants evidence. This man has been charged, but only because there was an independent video showing what happened. If there was no video, then how would that case have turned out? Would it have been another Michael Brown?

Then you have Tamir Rice, the case of an 11 year-old boy who was shot while playing with a BB gun by a Cleveland a police officer who had no business being a police officer.

Do Black Lives Matter? Not in Missouri, not in New York, not in Maryland, and not in Ohio. What is happening is that millions of Americans are seeing a law enforcement community that is out of control. What's being done about it? Apparently nothing.  Why would anything be done about it? The people that are being killed have no political power. They can't change anything. Black America is a slave to the Democratic party. They work and work and work for the Democrats for what? They are literally being shot dead in the street and no justice is being done. It's candyland, and it's about goddamned time Django showed up.

So what should be done. NUMBER 1 - each instance of police misconduct, whether it's theivery, abuse of force, or murder, should be investigated by an independent prosecutor that does not have a relationship of any nature to the agency that he is prosecuting or investigating. That's a simple,  easy and effective thing to do. Furthermore, if done properly, it could and would result in a dramatic increase in the confidence everyday citizens have in law enforcement.

Beyond that, law enforcement offices and county governments should be fiscally responsible for when someone is wrongly killed, arrested or has the property seized without cause. This should be **STRICT** liability. If the police make a wrongful arrest, then they should be strictly liable for such arrest. Too many officers arrest too many people for simply making the officer mad.

Finally, we need to end the dumb fucking war on drugs. It's crazy fucking stupid, and not working. Millions of people are in jail and you can still get any kind of drug you want any time you want. It has caused a militarization of law enforcement. and also it has caused law enforcement to become "for profit" institutions that prey upon low income segments of the population - especially minorities. 

If we are to have a society that respects the law, then we must have law enforcement officers that are trustworthy and reliable. If we are going to have trustworthy officers, then we must have a system in place to hold officers accountable when they violate the law and break the trust. That's not radical. That's not crazy. That's just common sense!
