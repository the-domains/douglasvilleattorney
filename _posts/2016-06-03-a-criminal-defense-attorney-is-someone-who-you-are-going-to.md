A criminal defense attorney is someone who you are going to rely upon to protect you from the government's attempts to take your liberty. Most of the time, the Government has unlimited money, time, and power at their disposal. Prosecutors are accountable to no one but the voters. 

So, what kind of person do you want in this situation. What are the traits or characteristics that you want and need in a criminal defense attorney?

First, you want a criminal defense attorney with KNOWLEDGE. A deep understanding of not only the law, but also of the community is essential. Criminal Law is a vast body of both substantive and procedural statues and cases. You need a criminal defense attorney that knows the law. But, that's not enough. You also need a criminal defense attorney that knows the community in which you are charged. Different jurisdictions handle similar situations differently. Procedures vary not only from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but also from courtroom to courtroom. You need an attorney that knows the Judges and the prosecutors in your jurisdiction. 

Secondly, you want a criminal defense attorney with a good REPUTATION. An attorney that is not respected will not achieve the best results for you. The Criminal Defense Attorney you hire must have a Reputation within the community as being both effective and ethical. A Reputation for effectiveness must include multiple trial victories in your jurisdiction. Only an experienced Trial Attorney will garner the type of respect you need for your case. Furthermore, your Criminal Defense Attorney must have a reputation for practicing ethically and professionally. Judges who do not trust an attorney will not be persuaded by his or her arguments or reasoning. 

Third, you need an attorney with INTEGRITY that you can trust. The relationship between you and your criminal defense attorney is critical for your liberty and pursuit of happiness - and in some situation for your life. If you don't trust your attorney, then how can you hope to rely upon his advice in making the best decision.

Fourth, you need a criminal defense attorney that will EMPATHIZE with your situation. The rest of the world make heap scorn and judgement upon you, but your criminal defense attorney should not. He should be your advocate by understanding your perspective, your life story, and your challenges. Your criminal defense attorney must work diligently to make sure you are always presented in the best light.

Fifth and finally, you need a criminal defense attorney that will WORK. Remember, your opponent, the government has virtually unlimited resources. In order to win, your advocate must pursue every angle, every defense, and every justification. He needs to spend time considering the possibilities of the case. 

You need a criminal defense attorney that has the Knowledge, Reputation, Integrity, Empathy, and Work ethic to protect your liberty and standing in the community. 

Criminal Defense Attorneys with these attributes are expensive. They are expensive because their services are in high demand. Criminal Defense Attorneys who lack these qualities are less expensive and will achieve less favorable outcomes for you.
