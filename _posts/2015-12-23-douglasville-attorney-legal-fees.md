DETERMINATION OF FEES

****

Fees are based on such factors as the degree of difficulty of a particular legal task, the amount of time involved, and the type of case.

Most services normally involve research, investigation and case preparation.

At our initial meeting, we will discuss the time anticipated to resolve the case, the difficulties likely to be encountered, and the complexity of the legal issues in your particular case. 

**RETAINERS**

A retainer is money you pay up front for legal services.

The amount of the retainer depends on the type case, your record of payment with my firm, and the overall amount of expected fees.

**TYPES OF FEES**

I use different types of fees depending on the type of case.

Some types of cases require hourly fees because the complexity and length of the case is too uncertain.

Other cases, may have a set procedure with high degree of certainty.

**Fixed Fees:**

A fixed fee is a simple, flat rate charge for a certain legal services.

Fixed fees are available only for certain types of cases.

Uncontested Divorces, Criminal Defense cases, and simple wills are examples of types of cases suitable for fixed fees.

**Hourly Charge:**

An hourly fee is used in most civil litigation cases.

Contract disputes, divorces, and appellant work are examples of the type of cases appropriate for hourly fees.

**Contingent Fees:**

In certain types of lawsuits---such as personal injury, collections and fraud, the fee is generally fixed at a percentage of the recovery. In a contingency fee contract, I will not get paid any fees unless you win your case. However, you will be charged for costs such as court filing fees or expenses paid to witnesses.

**Fees Awarded by the Court:**

In some cases, you may receive an award of attorney's fees as part your case. This is an amount which will be owed by the opposing party. The amount awarded by the court may be more or less than the amount which you have already agreed to pay.

**HOW TO HOLD DOWN LEGAL COSTS**  
**Before our meeting:**

\* Gather all information together in a logical order;

\* Be sure you have current correct telephone numbers and addresses of interested parties and witnesses, if applicable;

\* Prepare a written statement of your problems and what you want done;

\* Make photocopies of everything and offer originals or photocopies to your lawyer.

**During our initial consultation:**

\* Present an overall view of your position.

\* Share all relevant information. 

Throughout the case:

****

\* Communicate effectively by using email when possible.

\* Meet deadlines.

\* Stay organized.

****

**PAYMENT OPTIONS**

Payment options include cash, check, money order, and most credit cards.  When using a credit card, an additional processing fee is charged. Returned checks are subject to a processing fee. 

Payment plans are available in certain situations.
