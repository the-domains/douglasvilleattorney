description: 'With the prevalence of traffic cameras, smartphones and even police bodycams, nowadays almost anything that happens in public ends up on YouTube. A rash of videos showing police officers killing unarmed African-Americans helped galvanize activists and protesters. In April, the death of Freddie Gray while in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department led to rioting in the city and a Department of Justice probe. Meanwhile, that same month, a video of a police officer shooting Walter Scott to death in South Carolina as he ran away resulted in murder charges against the officer in question. At the end of the year in Chicago, newly released footage of a shooting from the previous year of 17-year-old African-American LaQuan McDonald resulted in the termination of Chicago’s chief of police, Garry McCarthy. Only months earlier, McCarthy had participated in a panel at the ABA Annual Meeting which was proposing potential reforms to improve relations between police and minority communities. In Cleveland on Dec. 28, a grand jury decided not to indict police officers for the 2014 shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. The boy had been playing in a park with a toy gun, and was killed by police who responded to a neighbor’s report of a possible gun. The incident had also been caught on video, and called into question the officers’ original account of events.'
